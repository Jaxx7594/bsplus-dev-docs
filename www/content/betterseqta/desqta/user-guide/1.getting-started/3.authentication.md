## Authentication Overview

DesQTA uses SEQTA's authentication system to securely log you in. Your credentials are never stored by DesQTA - authentication happens through SEQTA's official login system.

## Login Methods

DesQTA supports two authentication methods:

### Traditional Browser Login

The standard and most widely supported method:

**How it works:**
1. DesQTA opens a secure browser window
2. You log in using SEQTA's official login page
3. SEQTA validates your credentials
4. DesQTA receives an authentication token
5. You're logged in!

**Advantages:**
- Works with all SEQTA authentication types
- Supports two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Uses SEQTA's secure login system
- Familiar login experience

**Supported authentication types:**
- Username/password
- Email/password
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Single Sign-On (SSO) - if configured by school
- Active Directory integration - if configured by school

### QR Code Login

Quick authentication using your mobile device:

**How it works:**
1. DesQTA displays a QR code
2. Open SEQTA Learn mobile app on your phone
3. Navigate to QR code login in the app
4. Scan the QR code with your phone
5. Approve login on your phone
6. DesQTA authenticates automatically

**Requirements:**
- SEQTA Learn mobile app installed
- QR code login enabled by your school
- Phone and computer on same network (usually)

**Advantages:**
- Faster than typing credentials
- More secure (no password entry)
- Works if you're already logged into mobile app

## Logging In

### Step 1: Enter SEQTA URL

1. Launch DesQTA
2. In the login screen, enter your school's SEQTA URL
3. Format: `yourschool.seqtalearn.com` (no `https://`)
4. Press Enter or click "Next"

### Step 2: Choose Login Method

**For Traditional Login:**
1. Click **"Login"** button
2. Browser window opens
3. Log in with your SEQTA credentials
4. Wait for automatic detection

**For QR Code Login:**
1. Click **"QR Code Login"** option
2. QR code appears on screen
3. Open SEQTA mobile app
4. Scan QR code
5. Approve on phone

### Step 3: Wait for Authentication

DesQTA will:
- Validate your session
- Load your data
- Set up caching
- Initialize settings

**Time:** Usually 10-30 seconds

## Session Management

### Active Sessions

DesQTA maintains an active session with SEQTA:

- **Session Duration:** Typically 24 hours (depends on SEQTA settings)
- **Auto-Refresh:** DesQTA refreshes your session automatically
- **Background Sync:** Keeps data up-to-date

### Session Expiration

If your session expires:

1. You'll see a "Session Expired" message
2. Click "Login Again"
3. Re-authenticate using your preferred method
4. Your data and settings are preserved

**Note:** DesQTA doesn't store your password - you'll need to log in again.

### Staying Logged In

DesQTA keeps you logged in by:
- Refreshing tokens automatically
- Maintaining background connection
- Handling session renewal

**You'll stay logged in until:**
- You manually log out
- Session expires (after extended inactivity)
- You clear app data
- SEQTA invalidates your session

## Logging Out

### How to Log Out

1. Click your **profile picture** in the header
2. Click **"Logout"** from the dropdown menu
3. Confirm logout if prompted
4. You'll return to the login screen

### What Happens When You Log Out

- **Session Terminated:** Your SEQTA session ends
- **Local Data:** Cached data remains (for faster re-login)
- **Settings:** Your DesQTA settings are preserved
- **No Data Loss:** Nothing is deleted

**Note:** To clear all data, use Settings → Advanced → Clear Cache

If your school enables 2FA:

4. Complete login normally

**Supported 2FA methods:**

## Troubleshooting Authentication

### "Cannot connect to SEQTA"

**Check:**
- SEQTA URL is correct
- Internet connection is working
- SEQTA website loads in browser
- Firewall isn't blocking connection

**Solutions:**
- Verify URL format (no `https://`, no trailing slash)
- Test SEQTA in regular browser
- Check network settings
- Contact school IT if SEQTA is down

### "Login window doesn't open"

**Check:**
- Pop-up blocker settings
- Browser permissions
- Antivirus blocking

**Solutions:**
- Allow pop-ups for DesQTA
- Check browser settings
- Temporarily disable pop-up blocker
- Try clicking Login button again

### "Authentication failed"

**Possible causes:**
- Incorrect credentials
- Account locked
- Session conflict
- SEQTA server issues

**Solutions:**
- Verify credentials in regular browser
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Check if account is locked
- Contact school IT if persistent

### "QR code not working"

**Check:**
- Mobile app is updated
- QR code login enabled by school
- Phone and computer on same network
- Camera permissions granted

**Solutions:**
- Update SEQTA mobile app
- Try traditional login instead
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure QR code is fully visible

### "Session expired" frequently

**Possible causes:**
- Extended inactivity
- SEQTA session timeout
- Network issues
- Multiple device logins

**Solutions:**
- Log in again (normal behavior)
- Check SEQTA session settings
- Avoid logging in on multiple devices simultaneously
- Contact school IT if too frequent

## Multiple Accounts

### Switching Accounts

To use a different SEQTA account:

1. **Log out** of current account
2. **Enter different SEQTA URL** (if different school)
3. **Log in** with different credentials
4. DesQTA loads the new account's data

**Note:** DesQTA doesn't support multiple simultaneous accounts. Log out before switching.

### Account-Specific Settings

Each account has its own:
- Timetable and classes
- Assessments and grades
- Courses and materials
- Preferences and settings

Settings are preserved per account when you switch.

## Best Practices

### Security

- **Never share credentials:** Keep your login details private
- **Log out on shared devices:** Always log out on public computers
- **Use 2FA if available:** Enable two-factor authentication
- **Keep app updated:** Updates include security fixes

### Convenience

- **Stay logged in:** DesQTA handles session management automatically
- **Use QR code if available:** Faster and more secure
- **Bookmark SEQTA URL:** Save time on future logins
- **Enable auto-login:** If your school supports it
