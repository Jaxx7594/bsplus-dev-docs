## Welcome to DesQTA

When you first launch DesQTA, you'll be greeted with a clean, modern interface designed to help you get started quickly.

## Initial Setup Screen

The first launch experience guides you through:

1. **Welcome Message** - Brief introduction to DesQTA
2. **Login Screen** - Where you'll enter your SEQTA credentials
3. **Onboarding Tour** - Interactive guide to key features (after login)

## Entering Your SEQTA URL

Before you can log in, you need to provide your school's SEQTA Learn URL:

### Finding Your SEQTA URL

Your SEQTA URL typically follows one of these formats:
- `yourschool.seqtalearn.com`
- `seqta.yourschool.edu.au`
- `learn.yourschool.com`

**Where to find it:**
- Ask your school's IT department
- Check your school's website
- Look at your existing SEQTA login page URL
- Check emails from your school about SEQTA

### Entering the URL

1. In the login screen, locate the "SEQTA URL" field
2. Type your school's SEQTA URL (without `https://` or `http://`)
3. Example: `myschool.seqtalearn.com`
4. Press Enter or click "Next"

**Important:** 
- Don't include `https://` or `http://`
- Don't include trailing slashes
- Use the exact URL format your school uses

## Login Options

After entering your SEQTA URL, you'll see login options:

### Traditional Login (Recommended)

The standard way to log in:

1. Click the **"Login"** button
2. A browser window will open
3. Log in with your SEQTA credentials in the browser
4. DesQTA automatically detects your login
5. The browser window closes automatically
6. You're logged into DesQTA!

**Why this method:**
- Uses SEQTA's official login system
- Secure and familiar
