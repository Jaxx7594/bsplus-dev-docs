### Choosing Your Provider
There are multiple provider options available, each with their individual benefits. We suggest you choose Groq, as it has arguably the best free plan limits, the broadest selection of models, and is simple to set up.

This is a table comparing the major AI providers that are confirmed to be supported, though do note there are others that may be compatible.

| Provider  | Free Plan Quality  | Setup Simplicity  | Effectiveness  | Recommended  |
|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|----------------|--------------|
| OpenAI    |         🟥         |         🟥         |       🟩       |      🟧      |
| Gemini    |         🟧         |         🟩         |       🟧       |      🟧      |
| Groq      |         🟩         |         🟩         |       🟩       |      🟩      |
| Claude    |         🟥         |         🟥         |       🟩       |      🟧      |
| Ollama    |         🟩         |         🟥         |       ❔       |      🟥      |

🟩 = Yes/High<br>
🟧 = Maybe/Medium<br>
🟥 = No/Low<br>
❔ = Depends on setup

## Available Settings

### API Standard

The 'language' that your chosen AI website speaks in. The setup section details which of these options you should choose.

**Possible Options:**
- **[OpenAI](https://openai.com)**
- **[Ollama](https://ollama.com)**
- **[Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)**
- **[Claude](https://claude.ai)**
- **[Groq](https://groq.com)**

### API Base Endpoint

Where exactly the plugin talks to. The setup section details what you should set this to.

### API Key

The password that the plugin uses to prove that its allowed to access your specified AI endpoint. The setup section details where you can generate this.

### Model

Which model you would like to use. This will depend on what the AI service that you are using provides. The setup section details some common options and what we recommend you use.

### System Prompt

The instructions given to the AI model. This is available so that advanced users can tweak it to their specific model, generally the default will be good for all common models, so you wont need to change this.

### Show Summaries By Default

This plugin stores each summary you generate, so that when you reload the page, you do not have to waste time and money asking the AI to re-summarise the same text. This setting controls whether upon reload, the summary automatically shows, or the original shows (the button to switch between each is still available).
